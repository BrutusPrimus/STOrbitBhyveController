# STOrbitBhyveController Proxy Node
#### * SmartThings® Integration for the b•hyve™ hose faucet timers *
### Alpha Version: 0.0.1

---

## Description:
### This alpha proxy node server provides: 
1. Support for controlling 'open' or 'closed' Bhyve states from SmartThings.   
2. Pushover Messaging
3. Builds upon the base code for interfacing SmartThings and b•hyve™ with a Nodejs/MQTT/Websocket server for real-time response.

## Requirements:

1. Lots of patience and consideration for this very rough alpha release that will require several more hours/days/weeks of debugging and re-testing.  *I am not a Javascript/Node developer by nature, but I feel this language/platform is optimal for creating the asynchronous Websocket connection and API integration with SmartThings.*
2. Advanced knowledge of Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian) , Node, Javascript, File Editing, MQTT, etc
3. Raspberry Pi Server
	* Model 3 or higher for performance 
	* Debian Version Stretch or Buster
4. Orbit Bhyve Controller SmartApp
	* Version 4+
